## Quick Start

**NOTE**: The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the ngPost docker container with the following command:
```
docker run -d \
    --name=ngpost \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/ngpost:/config:rw \
    -v $HOME:/storage:ro \
    tr4il/ngpost
```

Where:
  - `/docker/appdata/ngpost`: This is where the application stores its configuration, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `$HOME`: This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible by the application.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the ngPost GUI.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.
